## Introduction

### About

Jocasta is a CLI tool to manage your to-do list with just a few keyboard strokes.
To download the CLI, an install script has been provided.

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgfranco17/jocasta/main/install.sh | bash
```

They always say not to just blindly run scripts from the internet, so feel free to examine
the file first before running.

> [!NOTE]
> This CLI is still an alpha prototype.
